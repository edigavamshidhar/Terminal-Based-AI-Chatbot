# Terminal-Based-AI-Chatbot
The Terminal-Based AI Chatbot is a lightweight, interactive conversational agent built with Python and NLTK. It uses a rule-driven approach to respond to user inputs such as greetings, FAQs, and simple queries. The project demonstrates how natural language processing can be applied in building intelligent systems with minimal resources.
The chatbot is primarily designed to run in a terminal interface, making it easy to test and extend. Additionally, an optional Flask-based web integration was implemented to allow deployment on a browser interface. This makes the project flexible for both local use and basic web-based applications.
